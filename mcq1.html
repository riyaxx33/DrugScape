        Dear diary, today was just another day of suffocating expectations. I spent hours buried in textbooks, my parents' voices echoing in my mind—“You must excel, Mei Lin. You’re our pride.” Sometimes I wonder if they even see me, the real me, beneath the grades and accolades.<br>
        But then there was Kai. He’s different—wild, carefree, and completely unbothered by the weight of expectations. When he laughed, it felt like a spark ignited inside me. He showed me a world where the rules bend and break, where I could actually breathe.<br>
        I can't believe I let him pull me in so easily. The pills, the powder... they were supposed to be a way to escape, to feel something other than this relentless pressure. It worked, for a moment. But now, the rush is fading, and the reality of what I’ve done is sinking in.<br>
        I thought I could handle it, but I’m scared. Scared of what I’m becoming, scared of my parents finding out, and scared of facing myself. I can’t keep living like this.<br>
        I need to dispose of the drugs. It’s the only way to reclaim a piece of myself. They’re in the next room, and I can’t let them control me any longer. Maybe this is the first step towards freedom.<br>
        I just hope I’m brave enough to take it.<br><br> What would you say to persuade Mei Lin not to use drugs if you found her diary as a friend?`, hotspot: "R2_1_Diary" },
